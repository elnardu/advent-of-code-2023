# AoC 2023

Keeping it simple and just using Python this year. Will actually try finish.

Also, don't use this code as an example for any purpose. I am trying for speed this year, so code is very bad.

## Usage

- Copy `cookies-template.json` to `cookies.json`
- Put your AoC session cookie there
- After that running `make` will do the following
  - Download today's input and put that into `/input`
  - Open today's problem in your browser
  - Copy `solution_template.py` to `/solutions`
  - Rerun that file on every change
